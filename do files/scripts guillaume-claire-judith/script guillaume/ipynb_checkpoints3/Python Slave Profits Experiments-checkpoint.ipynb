    "# Analysis of Slave Trade Profits - Python experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gerhard de Kok*\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is intended as a playground for experimenting with the data collected for the Slave Trade Profits-project. Jupyter is an interface for using the Python programming language. It gives the ability to run snippets of Python code and intersperse these snippets with explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project, we are still on the fence about the choice of analysis software (Stata, SPSS, Python, etc). The current notebook is intented to explore the possibilities of working with Python. To interact with this notebook, it is necessary to download the Notebook-file from GIT and have Python, Jupyter and Pandas installed. Pandas adds many data analysis functions to Python. One way to easily install the required software is through the <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual'>Anaconda Python distribution</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many advantages of using Jupyter notebooks and Python/Pandas for this project:\n",
    "1. We can create a notebook like this to show and clarify our calculations\n",
    "2. We can reuse the Python code from the notebook in an online webapp, should we want to create an online (interactive) database\n",
    "3. We can take advantage of the many Python libraries for advanced statistics, mapping or other tasks\n",
    "4. The solution is entirely open source and avoids proprietary software\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first load only my own (Dutch) data for some exloratory analysis, then I will try to load more data from our database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to loading our own database, I will also load the entire Voyages Database from the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database (downloadable through <a href='https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/downloads'> the TSTD-website</a>). It is quite painless to obtain complementary information on ships and voyages from the TSTD through Python/Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Getting started: working with the Dutch data\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data structure of Pandas is the <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe/'>dataframe</a>. In a way, this is like an Excel-table, but much more flexible and more powerful. There are many possible ways of working with our data, but I will do some first preliminary and experimental calculations in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Loading the relevant data in dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to load the data into Pandas dataframes. I will load our database into two separate dataframes: one for the venture data and one for the cashflows. I will also load the entire TSTD in its own dataframe. Once loaded, it is easy to combine the data into new, special-purpose, dataframes for further calculations or analysis. Our two tables are linked through the 'Voyage ID' key and (where possible) also to the TSTD through the TSTD ID. This gives us the possibility to freely link the databases."

    "Now that the Dutch data has all been loaded into memory, we can start our analysis. There are many possibilities, but for the present purposes I will combine relevant data into a new, custom-built dataframe to research the ROI on slave voyages. \n",

I want to include the year in which a ship came back to see possible developments over time. Therefore, the following script pulls missing data from the TSTD. It does the same for missing data on the region of slave voyages and number of slaves acquired. This can easily be done, since all of my voyages contain TSTD IDs. The result of the following script will be a new dataframe containing all the information I need for my analysis."
